### About the Data
The dataset from kaggle.com contains 17,823 observations and 15 column features of breweries in the U.S
and abroad. Information such as Id, address, categories, city, country, hours, keys, latitude, longitude,
menus, name, postalCode, province, twitter, and websites is provided. There are many missing in key features 
such as latitude and longitude. Other categorical features such as address, city, and province information has 
mislabeled information. For this project, I will be using this dataset to understand the craft brewery market
in the U.S and find out what are top brewery cities in the country. 

### Data Science Problem
To conduct a successful Data Science project, one must first ask a question. For this project I want to know what 
people are saying about craft beer in the top six brewery cities of the nation. To accomplish this, I plan to use
Python, Machine Leanrning, NLP, and Tableau to discover what people are saying about craft beer in the top brewery 
cities. 

### About the Project
The project has five main steps. The first step is to define a problem and ask a question. For this project, I have 
stated that my intent was to find out what the top brewery cities are saying about craft beer. Step two, involves initial 
Exploratory Data Aanalysis(EDA) and formulate a plan of attack. The third step involved data cleaning and preparation. 
The fourth step is to stream the data and prepare the data for analysis. Finally, in step five involves drawing analysing 
the output, drawing insights, and cocluding with observations or recomendations.
